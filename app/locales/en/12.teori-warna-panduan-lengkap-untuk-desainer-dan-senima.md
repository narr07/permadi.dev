Color theory is a guideline used by designers and artists to communicate through effective use of color. This theory encompasses principles in selecting, combining, and applying colors to create visually appealing and meaningful effects.

## History of Color Theory

Understanding of color theory has evolved over centuries:

1. Sir Isaac Newton (1666): Discovered the color spectrum through prism experiments.
2. Johann Wolfgang von Goethe: Developed color theory from a psychological perspective.
3. Albert Munsell (1858): Created a color system considering both physical and psychological aspects.

## Types of Colors

### Primary Colors

Primary colors consist of red, yellow, and blue. These colors cannot be produced by mixing other colors and form the basis for all other colors.

### Secondary Colors

Secondary colors are produced by mixing two primary colors:

- Green (blue + yellow)
- Orange (red + yellow)
- Purple (red + blue)

### Tertiary Colors

Tertiary colors are formed by mixing primary and secondary colors that are adjacent on the color wheel.

## Color Wheel

The color wheel is a visual tool that shows the relationship between various colors. It helps in understanding color harmony and effective combinations.

Understanding color theory is crucial in design because:

1. It influences user perception and emotions.
