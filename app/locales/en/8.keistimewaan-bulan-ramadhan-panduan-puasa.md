## Let's get to know the month of Ramadan better

- Friends, did you know? Ramadan is a special month that comes in the ninth month of the Hijri calendar. In this blessed month, the Qur'an is revealed as a guiding light for all of us. With great enthusiasm and sincerity, Muslims around the world observe fasting to get closer to Allah SWT and increase piety.
- The Hijriyah calendar that we use follows the movement of the moon in the sky. Interestingly, Ramadan always comes in the ninth month, with the timing determined through hilal observation or careful astronomical calculations. Because of the difference with the Gregorian calendar, every year we can experience the beauty of Ramadan 10-11 days earlier than the previous year.

## Features of the month of Ramadan

### 1. A Month Full of Blessings

Alhamdulillah, in this beautiful month of Ramadan, Allah SWT opens wide the doors of His heaven and tightly closes the doors of hell. The demons are also shackled so as not to interfere with our worship. How happy, every good deed we do, no matter how small, will get a double reward from Allah SWT. This blessing is not only in worship, but also brings peace and tranquility in our daily lives.

### 2. The Month of the Descent of the Qur'an

Ramadan is very special because in this month the Qur'an was first revealed to the Prophet Muhammad SAW through the Angel Gabriel in the Cave of Hira. This historic moment occurred on the glorious night of Lailatul Qadar. Therefore, let's multiply reading and studying the Qur'an in this holy month as a form of our love for the holy book that guides our lives.

### 3. The Beautiful Month of Forgiveness

How beautiful is the month of Ramadan that brings opportunities to repent and ask for forgiveness from Allah SWT. In this merciful month, Allah SWT opens the door of forgiveness as wide as possible for those of us who sincerely apologize for our mistakes. Every step towards goodness in this month is very special, and Allah SWT promises abundant forgiveness for those of us who really want to improve ourselves.

## Things We Need to Keep in the Month of Ramadan

Let's keep the glory of our fasting together by avoiding the following things:

- Eating and drinking during the day while fasting (unless there is a shar'i excuse)
- Saying bad words such as lying, gossiping, or hurting other people's hearts
- Things that can reduce the reward of our fast, such as:
  - Watching or listening to bad things
  - Fighting with other people
  - Doing things that are prohibited in Islam

## The Virtues that Allah Gives in the Month of Ramadan

### 1. Abundant Rewards

Good news! Every act of worship that we do in the month of Ramadan will receive multiple rewards from Allah SWT. The hadith narrated by Bukhari conveyed the happy news that voluntary deeds can be rewarded 10 to 700 times, and mandatory deeds can be rewarded up to 70 times compared to ordinary days. Subhanallah, how Allah loves us so much!

### 2. A Night Better than a Thousand Months

The night of Lailatul Qadar is a special gift from Allah SWT that usually comes on the odd nights of the last ten days of Ramadan. On this blessed night, angels descend to earth bringing mercy and blessings. Worship on this night is very special, and Allah SWT is ready to provide abundant forgiveness for those of us who live the night with worship.

### 3. Abundant Opportunities for Worship

Alhamdulillah, the month of Ramadan gives us many opportunities to get closer to Allah SWT through tarawih prayers in congregation, Qur'anic tadarus, charity, and i'tikaf in the mosque. The beautiful spiritual atmosphere, coupled with fasting during the day, makes it easier for our hearts to focus on worship and get closer to Allah SWT.

## What Cancels Our Fasting?

Let's look at the things that can break the fast:

- Eating and drinking intentionally during the day, be it any food or drink that we consciously put into our mouths
- Having intercourse during the day while fasting. This not only breaks the fast but also requires us to pay expiation (fasting 60 consecutive days or feeding 60 needy people)
- Vomiting intentionally
- For Muslim women, the onset of menstruation or postpartum bleeding (but don't worry, it can be replaced on another day).
- Leaving Islam (na'udzubillah min dhalik)

## When is our fast invalid?

Some things that make our fast need to be replaced on another day:

- Eating or drinking intentionally during the day, including swallowing saliva that has come out of the mouth or food residue in the teeth
- Doing things that are forbidden during fasting such as lying, backbiting, or arguing that can reduce the blessing of our fasting

## Who gets relief from fasting?

Allah SWT is merciful, some groups are given relief from fasting:

- Children who have not yet reached puberty. But the good thing is, they can start practicing fasting according to their ability
- Old people who are weak and unable to fast. They can compensate by feeding the needy (fidyah).
- People who have chronic illnesses that can be dangerous if they fast (according to doctor's advice). They can also pay fidyah instead.

## Conclusion

Alhamdulillah, the month of Ramadan is truly an amazing gift from Allah SWT that gives us the opportunity to cleanse ourselves, increase our piety, and get closer to Him. By practicing fasting and other deeds with sincerity, we can achieve abundant blessings and rewards in this glorious month. Let's make the most of this golden opportunity to become a better person and get closer to Allah SWT.
