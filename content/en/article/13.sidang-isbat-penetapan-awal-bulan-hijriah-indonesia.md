## Definition of Sidang Isbat

Sidang isbat is an official meeting held by the Ministry of Religious Affairs of the Republic of Indonesia to determine the beginning of months in the Hijri calendar, especially important months such as Ramadan, Shawwal, and Dhul-Hijjah. The word "isbat" comes from Arabic meaning confirmation, determination, or designation.

## Purpose of Sidang Isbat

Sidang isbat is held with several important purposes:

1. To provide legal certainty and uniformity in determining the beginning of Hijri months.
2. To minimize differences in establishing the beginning of Ramadan, Eid al-Fitr, and Eid al-Adha in society.
3. To accommodate various methods of determining the beginning of months used by religious organizations in Indonesia.
4. To maintain religious harmony and tolerance in Indonesia through a process of deliberation and consensus.
