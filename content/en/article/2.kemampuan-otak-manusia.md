### Parts of the Brain: The Multitasking Little One

Don't think the brain is just a gray blob. Our brain has many parts, each of which has a specific task. For example:

- Cerebrum: This is the largest part of the brain that manages things like thinking, learning, and remembering things. Everything that makes you ‚Äúyou‚Äù is organized here.
- Amygdala: This small but powerful part regulates your emotions. Whether you're happy, sad, or angry, the amygdala does the job.
- Brainstem: This one does more basic things like regulating your breathing, heart rate, and other automatic things. Just imagine, all these parts work together every second without stopping. That's pretty cool, right?

### Brain Skills: Not Just Smart, But Also Sensitive

Our brain is not only good at thinking, you know. It's also good at feeling. There are two main brain abilities that make us fully human:

1. Cognitive Ability: This is the brain's ability to think, learn, process information, and solve problems. So if you're thinking about how to pay your bills and still be able to hang out with friends, that's your brain at work.
2. Emotional Ability: The brain is also what makes us feel emotions. For example, why you can cry when watching a sad movie or laugh at a funny meme. It's all thanks to the cooperation between the amygdala and other parts of the brain.

How cool is that?
