## 1. Level Students' Concentration: Make it less distracting! ðŸŽ¯

If you often have trouble focusing when studying, try playing with colors in your study room or stationery.

- **Green**: Besides making your eyes cool, this color also helps your brain stay fresh and not easily tired. Perfect for reading or studying heavy subjects.
  **Tips:**
- Paint the walls of your study room light blue or green.
- Use blue sticky notes for important notes.
- Avoid colors that are too bright like bright red because it can cause stress.

## 2. Ability to remember material: Let's Not Forget! ðŸ§

- **Blue**: Perfect for work that requires high concentration.
  **Tips:**
- Use a colorful planner or to-do list to keep your tasks organized.
